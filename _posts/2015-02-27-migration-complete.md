# My notes

Migration complete from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) to
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)! Wordpress is a great software and I recommend
it to anyone who needs a complex portal with an easy-to-use interface.
However, I do not have much time to deal with self-hosted Wordpress server
anymore, so I migrated to Jekyll.
The [Github](https://github.com) provides a free repository for hosting static
websites using Jekyll. The service is named
[Github-Pages](https://pages.github.com), and I strongly
recommend it for whom wants a free hosting blog, with the possibility to use a
custom domain name and, after all, being provided by Github.

# Fine tunning

To separate the main page into categories, I used the following code that I figured out by myself.
If you need help to understand this code, you may write a message in the comments.

# Original migration welcome message

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve --watch`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
