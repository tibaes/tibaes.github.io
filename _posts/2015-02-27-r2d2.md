## Introduction

As a computer scientist, I adopted the **R2D2** methodology to split my work time according to the four topics: **research**, **design**, **develop** and **report**. Well, to be fair I invented this name just for fun, but if you split your day time to do at least a period of each, you can reach an increase in productivity! Actually, I use a ToDo  list to remember me the work that must be done, where each item can take one hour. The list is valid for the next work day, where I put around seven itens, giving seven work hours. Remember, you must be realist and reserve one free hour, just in case you need extra time in something. The order matters, you must alternate among the kind of work, if it is a research, design, development or reporting work.

## Research

The research work is the exploratory one. Search in web for new papers, read the news, read papers and books, take classes… this is the time to learn something new. The research time is by far the most important and you may reserve more time for this one. If you are a student and has classes to take, account the hours too, so you can better distribute your time to other topics.

## Design

In short, think and make decisions. It is common to not reserve time to think, but you must reserve this time. Use this period to plan your next day, to design algorithms and to think about the research you are studying. You may review your entire research looking for new solutions.

## Develop

In my research I need to code. Everything I read need a code, so this period has volatile demand according the research stage. However, a good programmer need a lot of practice, so if you have nothing to code in your research, reserve a minimal time to practice a programming language. If you are not in the computer scientist, use this time to perform the labor work.

## Report

I think nobody likes to write reports. However, if you train yourself to report your research every day, your life will be easier when you need to write a paper or a full report to your boss. Write down your experiments and your design decisions. Keep in mind that you must store the knowledge, otherwise you just lost time (and money!).

## Final remarks

![](/assets/posts/r2d2.jpg)It was presented tips on how to use the time in academia. Split your work day in a set of short periods of time with around one hour each. Distribute these periods to perform activities of research, design, development and reporting; at least one period for each. Sometimes you need to perform a task related to more than one, and sometimes related to none. Do not panic. Take a little break between periods, specially if you work with computers, and try to avoid consecutive periods demanding a computer. Remember also to be realist about the time and to have fun.
