This post is about my application to [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/#land-just-perfect-devs-now). This company focus on remote jobs for software engineers, providing the connection between the developer and the client.

I applied for a C++ position, for it is my main language for over 5 years of experience with research and development of computer vision algorithms. My interest in a remote job is the possibility to live anywhere I want. So I could finally move to different places in Europe, to learn languages and cultures, without worries about my job.

Also, I believe that an international experience would be a good deal for my career as software engineer. I am new to professional programming, as my background is strongly academic. However, I want to make my path as a professional coder, dealing with real-world problems. Details about my background are better described in the [about page](http://fael.nl/about/).
