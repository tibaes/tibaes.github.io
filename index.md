# About

My name is Rafael Henrique Tibães, born in 1990. I graduated in Computer Science at [Federal University of Parana](http://www.inf.ufpr.br). Nowdays, I am a software developer at [Akiyama](http://www.akiyama.com.br).  My favorite field of study is video processing, specifically motion analysis problems, such as behavioral and action recognition; scene understanding; optical flow; object detection, recognition and tracking. Now I am working with affective computing & biometrics, i.e. face analysis and expressions, fingerprint, iris and signature. I am also interested in drones, 3d printers, robotics, embedded computing and psychology. More details in my [curriculum](http://fael.nl/cv.pdf).
