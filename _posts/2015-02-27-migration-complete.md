Migration complete from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org) to
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)! Wordpress is a great software and I recommend
it to anyone who needs a complex portal with an easy-to-use interface.
However, I do not have much time to deal with self-hosted Wordpress server
anymore, so I migrated to Jekyll.
The [Github](https://github.com) provides a free repository for hosting static
websites using Jekyll. The service is named
[Github-Pages](https://pages.github.com), and I strongly
recommend it for whom wants a free hosting blog, with the possibility to use a
custom domain name and, after all, being provided by Github.
