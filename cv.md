![](/assets/profile.png)My name is Rafael Henrique Tibães, born in 1990. I am a **Software Engineer** with experience in **Computer Vision**, **Data Analysis** and **High Performance Computing**. My favorite field of study is video processing, specifically motion analysis problems, such as behavioral and action recognition; scene understanding; optical flow; object detection, recognition and tracking. Now I am working with affective computing & biometrics, i.e. face analysis and expressions, fingerprint, iris and signature.
