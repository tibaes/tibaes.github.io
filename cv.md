Software Developer with experience in Biometrics, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and High Performance Computing; because real-time vision applications are awesome!

## Basic Information
* Born in 1990.
* Living in Curitiba, Brazil.
* Brazilian and Portuguese citizenship.

## Work Experience
* Biometrics research at [iVision, UFBA](http://www.ivisionlab.eng.ufba.br)(since 2016)
* Biometrics development at [Akiyama, Curitiba](http://akiyama.com.br) (since 2015)
* Academic researcher at [IMAGO Research Group, UFPR](http://www.imago.ufpr.br) (2008-2015)

## Education
* Master of Science (Interrupted), Informatics at [Federal University of Paraná (UFPR)](http://www.ufpr.br) (2012-2014)
* Bachelor of Science, Computer Science at [Federal University of Paraná (UFPR)](http://www.ufpr.br) (2008-2012)

## Projects
* Real-time face analysis and identification using 2D/3D images (ICAO);
* Newborns identification using high-resolution fingerprint images;
* Biometrics as a service, i.e. integrating face, fingerprint and iris into commercial systems.
* Affective computing with focus in motion processing and behaviour modelling.
* Indie iOS App developer, actually working on my secret project.

## Communication Skills
Good communication skills acquired through working experience in a research team specialized in different areas, like informatics, healthcare and arts; presentation of projects in seminars and teaching assistance. Languages: **Portuguese** is my mother tongue; **English**, full business proficiency (B2); **German**, basic user (A1).

## Researcher Skills
My expertise is in development of real-time **Biometrics** solutions: face, iris, fingerprint, signature, emotion, behavior and motion analysis. To perform pattern recognition over images and videos, I studied **Machine Learning** concepts, such as: dimensionality reduction, clustering, classification, regression, prediction, and multivariate statistics. As a **Computer Vision** researcher, I worked with a range of cameras: webcams (traditional RGB), Bumblebee (stereo vision), Breukmann (structured light), Microsoft Kinect (structured infrared light) and Kinect One (time of flight), Intel RealSense (structured infrared light), PanTiltZoom Axis, professional Canon cameras, lenses and programming via CHDK, Gopro, and security cameras with night vision. Real-time video processing is challenging, so also I studied the key principles of the **High Performance Computing**, i.e. parallel programming and architecture optimizations.

## Developer Skills
**Julia** for scientific computation; C / **C++** for higher performance (c++11, STL, Boost); **OpenCV**, Halide, OpenCL and CUDA libraries for computer vision and parallel computing; Enthusiast of Qt, Apple Swift, Wolfram Mathematica, Python, Ruby, R, Node.JS, and Unix Shell.

## IT Skills
Experience with Linux and FreeBSD web and processing servers, using local or cloud VPS based solutions; usage and configuration of services like DNS, VPN, firewall, apache, dropbox, git, ssh, MySQL and Wordpress; enthusiast of high performance cluster and network infrastructure.
